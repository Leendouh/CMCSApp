# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

## Overview

The **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of submitting and approving monthly claims for independent contractor lecturers. Lecturers can submit claims for work completed, and academic managers and program coordinators can review, approve, or reject these claims. The system is built using the **.NET Core MVC** framework, offering a user-friendly interface for both lecturers and administrative staff.

## Features

### Lecturer
- **Submit Claims**: Lecturers can submit claims for the hours worked on different modules. The form captures personal and claim-specific details such as the module, hours, hourly rate, and program.
- **View Previous Claims**: Lecturers can view previously submitted claims, which include the status (pending, approved, or rejected). Claims with a pending status can be edited, while approved or rejected claims are read-only.
- **Filter/Search Claims**: A filter/search functionality allows lecturers to easily find claims based on module or status.
- **Upload Supporting Documents**: Lecturers can upload optional supporting documents when submitting claims.

### Program Coordinator
- **Review Claims**: Program coordinators can review claims submitted by lecturers, verifying details such as the module taught, hours worked, and rate.
- **Edit or Confirm Claims**: Program coordinators can edit details if necessary or confirm the accuracy of claims before proceeding to approval.
- **Ensure Claim Integrity**: Coordinators are responsible for ensuring that all claim details are correct before they are forwarded for final review or approval.

### Academic Manager
- **Approve/Reject Claims**: Academic managers have the ability to review submitted claims and either approve or reject them. 
- **View Claim Details**: The manager can view all claim-related details, including modules, hours worked, total amounts, and supporting documents.
- **Status Updates**: Managers update the status of each claim (approved, pending, or rejected) after reviewing them.

## System Architecture
The system follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern:

1. **Model**: Represents the database structure, capturing claim information, user profiles, and system status updates.
2. **View**: The user interface for lecturers, coordinators, and managers to interact with the system. It is designed with user experience in mind, allowing easy submission, review, and management of claims.
3. **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the views and models, handling the business logic of claim submission, review, and approval.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - .NET Core SDK (Version 6.0 or higher)
   - Visual Studio or any IDE supporting .NET Core projects
